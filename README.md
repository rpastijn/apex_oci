Demonstrating how to use REST API calls from APEX to the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI)

My goal was to display information from Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) inside APEX. While executing REST-API calls from APEX is easy, the big issue was the (for me) complex signing requirement of OCI. Since there was no option inside APEX or function inside PL/SQL to do this, I went on a quest to make this happen. I succeeded and the result can be downloaded from this project.
